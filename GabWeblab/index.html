        <p class="intro">My name is Gabriel Brasil, journalist, designer and techonologist in the making, currently doing grad school at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. This is my web development lab, where I'll test code hapharzadly (as made clear with this choice of font).</p>

        <h4>HTML basics</h4>
        <p>During the first week I went through the first chapters of Lynda.com's "Basic HTML" online course. There I was able to learn what HTML is really for, and it is <strong>NOT</strong> to make text bigger or smaller</p>
        </section>
        <h3 id="week02">Week 2</h3>
        <p>Second Week, and I mostly focused on basic CSS and practicing my newl aquired HTML skills. Also, I created <strong>this very site!</strong>.</p>
        <p>On the downside, I still have a hard time using Javascript of any kind on it, even after going through ICM classes (basic P5 javascript programing.) </p>
